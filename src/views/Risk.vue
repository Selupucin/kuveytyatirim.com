      EXPLANATION OF RISKS FOR FOREIGN TEMPORARY AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS
      This short notice, in addition to the General Business Conditions, does
      not aim to state all risks and other important aspects of foreign currency
      and derivative transactions. If you do not know the nature of the
      contracts you enter, the legal aspects of these relationships under such
      contracts, or your degree of exposure, you should not resolve the
      transactions of those products, considering the risks. Foreign currency
      and derivative transactions are high risk, so they are not suitable for
      many people. Considering your experience, goals, financial resources and
      other important factors, you should thoroughly evaluate how appropriate
      these types of transactions are for you.
      <br /><br />

      1. ACTIVITIES WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY AND DERIVATIVE 1.1 Leveraged trading
      means growing potential profits; It also means that losses are magnified.
      The lower the margin requirement, the higher the risk of potential loss if
      the market moves against you. Sometimes the required margins can be as
      little as 0.5%. When trading using margin, keep in mind that your losses
      can exceed your initial payment and it is possible to lose much more money
      than you originally invested. The amount of the initial margin may appear
      small compared to the values of foreign exchange contracts or derivatives,
      because the "leverage" or "gear" effect is used during the trading
      transaction. Relatively noteworthy market movements will have a
      proportionally increasing effect on the amounts invested or deposited by
      you. This can happen to or against you. While supporting your position,
      there may be any loss in the degree of the initial margin and the amount
      of money invested in the Company. If your market position starts to move
      in the opposite direction and / or the amount of margin required
      increases, the Company may ask you to urgently deposit additional funds to
      support the position. Failure to meet additional deposit requirements may
      result in your Company's position (s) being closed, and you will be
      responsible for any loss or deficiency associated with them. 1.2 Orders
      and Strategies that Reduce Risk Placing certain orders (eg "stop-stop"
      orders) or "stop-limit" orders that limit the maximum loss amount, if
      permitted by local law, may be inefficient in the event of a market
      situation, making it impossible to execute such orders (for example, in
      the case of market liquidity). Any strategy that uses combinations of
      positions, for example "spread" and "invasion", may not be less risky than
      those common with "long" and "short" positions.
      <br /><br />

      2. ADDITIONAL RISKS FOR TRANSACTIONS WITH FOREIGN TEMPORARY AND
      DERIVATIVES 2.1 Conditions of entry into contracts You need to obtain
      detailed information from your broker about the conditions of entering
      into contracts and the obligations associated with them (for example, in
      the circumstances, where you can accrue the obligation to realize or
      accept any asset within the framework of a delivery) in the event of a
      futures contract or an option. and information on time limits for the
      implementation of options). Under some circumstances, a stock exchange or
      clearinghouse may change the requirements of undecided contracts
      (including strike price) to reflect changes in the market for that asset.
      <br /><br />
      2.2 Suspension or limitation of trade. Price correlation
      <br /><br />
      Some market situations (eg liquidity) and / or rules of business of some
      markets (for example, suspension of trade according to contracts, for
      months, due to excess in the boundaries of price changes) may increase.
      losses incurred as performing operations or squaring / sharpening
      positions become difficult or impossible. If you sell options, losses may
      increase. A well-grounded interconnection is not always between the
      asset's prices and the derivative asset. The absence of an asset's
      reference price can make the "fair value" estimate difficult.
      <br /><br />
      2.3 Funds deposited and property
      <br /><br />
      When conducting an operation in your country or abroad, you should be
      knowledgeable about protective tools within the limits of Security that
      you invest in the form of cash or other assets, especially if the firm
      performing a bankruptcy or bankruptcy. subject. The extent to which you
      can return your cash or other assets is regulated by the legislation of
      the Counterparty and the local country standards.
      <br /><br />
      2.4 Commission fees and other costs
      <br /><br />
      Before joining any trades, you should get clear information about all
      commission fees, payments and any other expenses that you have to pay.
      These expenses will affect your net financial result (profit or loss).
      <br /><br />
      2.5 Transactions in other jurisdictions
      <br /><br />
      Trading transactions in other jurisdictions, including those that are
      officially linked to your internal market, may pose additional risks to
      you. The regulation of the mentioned markets may differ from yours in
      terms of investor protection (including a lower degree of protection from
      you). Your local regulatory authority cannot ensure that the rules set
      forth in regulatory authorities or other jurisdictions where you operate
      by markets are compulsory.
      <br /><br />
      2.6 Currency risk
      <br /><br />
      Unlike the currency of your account, the profit and loss of transactions
      with foreign currency contracts are affected by fluctuations in the
      exchange rate when converted from the contract currency to the account
      currency.
      <br /><br />
      2.7 Liquidity risk
      <br /><br />
      Liquidity risk affects your ability to trade. Risk of your CFD or asset
      not being traded at the time you want to trade (preventing a loss or
      making a profit). Additionally, the margin you need to deposit to the CFD
      provider as a deposit is recalculated daily based on changes in the value
      of the underlying assets of your CFDs. If this recalculation (revaluation)
      causes a decrease in value compared to the previous day's value, you will
      need to pay the CFD supplier immediately to adjust the margin and close
      the loss. If you are unable to pay, the CFD provider may close your
      position whether or not you participate in this action. Then, even if the
      price of the underlying asset is recovered, you will have to cover the
      loss. If you don't have the required margin, even if one of these
      positions shows profit for you at that stage, there are CFD providers who
      are liquidating all your CFD positions. To keep your position open, you
      may need to allow the CFD provider to receive additional payments (usually
      from your credit card) at its discretion when necessary for the relevant
      margin calls. In a fast-moving, volatile market, you can easily manage a
      large credit card bill this way.
      <br /><br />
      2.8 "Stop loss" limits
      <br /><br />
      Many CFD providers offer you the opportunity to choose “stop loss” limits
      to limit losses. This automatically closes your location when it reaches a
      price limit you choose. For example, there are some situations where the
      “stop loss” limit is ineffective when there are rapid price movements or
      market closings. Stop loss limits cannot always protect you from losses.
      <br /><br />
      2.9 Execution risk
      <br /><br />
      Enforcement risk is related to the fact that transactions cannot be
      realized immediately. For example, there may be a delay between when you
      place your order and when it is processed. During this period, the market
      may have acted against you. So, your order does not come at the price you
      expect. Some CFD providers allow you to trade even when the market is
      closed. Note that the prices of these trades may differ greatly from the
      closing price of the underlying asset. In many cases, the spread may be
      wider than when the market was open.
      <br /><br />
      2.10 Counterparty risk
      <br /><br />
      Counterparty risk is the risk that the provider that issued the CFD (i.e.
      your counterparty party) will default and fail to meet its financial
      obligations. If your funds are not properly separated from the CFD
      provider's funds and the CFD provider faces financial difficulties, there
      is a risk that you will not be able to withdraw any money from you.
      <br /><br />
      2.11 Trading systems
      <br /><br />
      Most of the usual "voice" and electronic commerce systems use computer
      devices to clear routing orders, balancing transactions, registration and
      transactions. As with other electronic devices and systems, these are
      subject to temporary failure and malfunction. Your chances for
      reimbursement for certain losses may depend on the limits of liability set
      by the trading systems supplier, markets, clearing and / or trading
      companies. These limits may change; You should get detailed information
      from your broker about this.
      <br /><br />
      2.12 Electronics trade
      <br /><br />
      Trading transactions using any Electronic Communication Network may differ
      not only from trading transactions in the normal "open circuit" market but
      also from trading transactions using other electronic trading systems. If
      you take any action on the Electronic Communication Network, you take
      risks specific to this system, including a risk of failure in the
      operation of the hardware or software. System failure may result in: Your
      order may not be fulfilled in accordance with the instructions; an order
      may never be fulfilled; It may not be possible to get continuous
      information about your positions or fulfill collateral requirements.
      <br /><br />
      2.13 Bench Top operations
      <br /><br />
      In some jurisdictions, firms are allowed to perform over-the-counter
      transactions. Your agency can act as a response to these transactions. The
      nature of such transactions depends on the complexity or impossibility of
      closing positions, estimating values, or determining the reasonable price
      or risk exposure. For the reasons mentioned above, these transactions can
      be associated with increased risks. The regulation that manages
      over-the-counter operations may be less strict or provide a specific
      editing mode. You will need to be familiar with the rules and risks
      associated with them before carrying out such transactions.
